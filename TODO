Pragma statements in sqlite? http://www2.sqlite.org/pragma.html

document 'python -m screed.fadbm' and such

You can write 'has_key', __contains__, as 'key in self'

I would suggest moving the stuff in __init__ into a submodule and then
importing it back in.  That way you don't have a big chunk of code
in __init__, which for some reason strikes me as Bad.

I think faiter and fqiter should be in a separate file -- how about
fasta.py and fastq.py?  Then you can group all format-specific stuff
in those files and simply import where you need them.

I think you should ditch general use of _screed_attr; it confuses
introspection, and is only needed for specific attributes.  We can
provide specific hooks for those who need to do substr slicing.
