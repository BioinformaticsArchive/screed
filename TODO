Pragma statements in sqlite? http://www2.sqlite.org/pragma.html

fix the conversion so can be achieved with text -> text instead of
db -> text

add more fastq parser variants

get bigtests working again

benchmarking:
 - use all same parsing functions, different createdbs to test creation
   time
 - write class with interface that implements screed's access methods
 - similar structure in each test db: create index on name column

I would suggest moving the stuff in __init__ into a submodule and then
importing it back in.  That way you don't have a big chunk of code
in __init__, which for some reason strikes me as Bad.

--

I think faiter and fqiter should be in a separate file -- how about
fasta.py and fastq.py?  Then you can group all format-specific stuff
in those files and simply import where you need them.

--

I think you should ditch general use of _screed_attr; it confuses
introspection, and is only needed for specific attributes.  We can
provide specific hooks for those who need to do substr slicing.
 - allow specifying of 'slicable' attributes in construction of
   databases (admin table)

--

install files necessary for test, too!

make it 'python -m screed.tests.__main__' instead of '.run'.

add a __repr__ function to the screedDB class so that it tells you
what db is opened, and what format it is from.

is there a way to figure out what the fields are for each record?

should the stuff in screed.txt work as a doctest?  right now it doesn't
even work!

the docs should also be updated for the lazy indexing stuff (once it's
removed).

A distressing lack of '_' between words in names ('faiter' => 'fasta_iter',
maybe?) and PEP-8 noncompliance, e.g. screedDB should be ScreedDB, although
I kind of agree that screedDB is prettier.

---

rename screed_pygr_api to just 'pygr.py', i.e.

  from screed.pygr import ...

---

for _screed_attr, as discussed, we should use it ONLY for FASTA
records/sequence attribute.  and __repr__ should definitely NOT
be doing the database retrieval -- only 'str'.

---

might be worth showing an example of how to use fqiter/faiter on
fasta/fastq files.

name collision: screed/toFasta.py != screed.toFasta
