Pragma statements in sqlite? http://www2.sqlite.org/pragma.html

fix the conversion so can be achieved with text -> text instead of
db -> text

add more fastq parser variants

get bigtests working again

install files necessary for test, too!

make it 'python -m screed.tests.__main__' instead of '.run'.

add a __repr__ function to the screedDB class so that it tells you
what db is opened, and what format it is from.

is there a way to figure out what the fields are for each record?

should the stuff in screed.txt work as a doctest?  right now it doesn't
even work!

the docs should also be updated for the lazy indexing stuff (once it's
removed).

A distressing lack of '_' between words in names ('faiter' => 'fasta_iter',
maybe?) and PEP-8 noncompliance, e.g. screedDB should be ScreedDB, although
I kind of agree that screedDB is prettier.

rename screed_pygr_api to just 'pygr.py', i.e.

  from screed.pygr import ...

---

for _screed_attr, as discussed, we should use it ONLY for FASTA
records/sequence attribute.  and __repr__ should definitely NOT
be doing the database retrieval -- only 'str'.

---

might be worth showing an example of how to use fqiter/faiter on
fasta/fastq files.

---

fqdbm incorrectly prints out two _ in '__screed'?

---

name collision: screed/toFasta.py != screed.toFasta

---

attempting to open a non-existent db creates the db (default sqlite behavior).
Bad.

---

what happens if you run read_fasta_sequences twice?
