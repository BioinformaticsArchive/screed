install files necessary for test, too!

is there a way to figure out what the fields are for each record?

PEP-8 noncompliance, e.g. screedDB should be ScreedDB, although
I kind of agree that screedDB is prettier.

rename screed_pygr_api to just 'pygr.py', i.e.

  from screed.pygr import ...

  [AN] err... why? screed_pygr_api->pygr.py confuses with 'real'
  pygr module while 'screed_pygr_api' explicitly describes what it is

__repr__ should definitely NOT
be doing the database retrieval -- only 'str'.

 [AN] ok what looks better for comparing?
 db[name] == db[name] # using __repr__
 or
 str(db[name]) == str(db[name]) # using __str__

 [AN] should __repr__ even exist for this class? if so, should it
 alias __str__? if not, comparisons must explicitly convert to
 __str__'s or write some kind of custom comparison between __repr__'s?

what happens if you run read_fasta_sequences twice?
