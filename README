seqdb2
======

seqdb2 is a database reader and writer designed to operate on FASTA and FASTQ
files. The writer portions are responsible for parsing FASTA or FASTQ files into
a unified seqdb2 database. The seqdb2 reader is responsible for reading these
databases and returning records by number (index) or by name.

BUILD
=====

seqdb2 uses the cmake program to provide cross-platform makefiles. Besides
cmake, you need pyrex installed and python2.4 or greater. To run the optional
nosetests you will need to install nose as well.

In the seqdb2/ top-level directory run:
cmake .
make

to build the program.

RUN
===

To run the optional nosetests after compiling, run 'nosetests' in the top-level
seqdb2 directory
